# Remy Setup

Remy has two halves:

1. **Local GUI** (`gui.py`) — where you create, edit, and delete
   reminders. They're saved to `data/reminders.json` inside the repo.
2. **Cloud scheduler** (`backend/reminder_scheduler.py`) — runs once an
   hour, reads that same `data/reminders.json`, and identifies which
   reminders are due.

The two halves are connected by git: after changing reminders in the GUI,
click **"Push to Cloud"** to commit and push `data/reminders.json`. The
cloud job pulls the latest copy of the repo before each run.

## Delivery is not configured yet

`backend/reminder_scheduler.py` finds due reminders and logs them, but
doesn't send them anywhere — `deliver_reminder()` in that file is a stub
that raises `NotImplementedError`. Wire in a provider there (SMS, email,
push notification, etc.) when one is chosen; this doc will get a setup
section for whatever that ends up being.

## Managing reminders

Run `python gui.py` to open Remy:

- **+ Add Reminder** — set the message text, and either:
  - *Every hour (within a window)* — fires once every hour between a
    start and end hour on the days you pick (e.g. 9:00–21:00, every day).
  - *At a specific time* — fires once during the hour containing that
    time, on the days you pick (e.g. 10:00 on Fridays).
- **Active** switch — pause a reminder without deleting it.
- **Timezone** — set the IANA timezone (e.g. `America/New_York`) used to
  evaluate schedules.
- **Push to Cloud** — commits and pushes `data/reminders.json` so the
  cloud job picks up your changes on its next hourly run.

## Known limitations

- The scheduler runs **once an hour**, so "at a specific time" reminders
  fire sometime during that hour, not necessarily at the exact minute.
- Changes only take effect after you click "Push to Cloud" — the cloud
  job doesn't see local, unpushed edits.

## Running the scheduler manually (for testing)

```bash
python backend/reminder_scheduler.py
```

This logs which reminders are due right now; nothing is sent until a
delivery provider is implemented.
